#EMBEDDED_NOTES
#A nominal drag coefficient of 0.3 is typical of contemporary mid-size sedans, such as Honda Accord, Toyota Camry, and Ford Fusion.
#
#The drag coefficient typically increases a few percent as the vehicle develops an aerodynamic side slip angle, peaking around 20 degrees. Drag reduces as side slip increases because the component of the airspeed in the vehicle X direction reduces.
